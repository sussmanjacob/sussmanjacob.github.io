Hi, my name is Jacob! I am an incoming Biostatistics PhD student at the Duke University School of Medicine. I'm broadly interested in applying quantitative and computational methods to questions in epidemiology and public health. I have interests in Bayesian hierarchical modelling, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics. I'm most driven by applications that consider public health in a social context, and focus on health justice.
